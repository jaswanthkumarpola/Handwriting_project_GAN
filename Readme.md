z# 🖊️ Handwriting Generator using GAN (PyTorch)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** in PyTorch to generate synthetic handwriting images.  
It trains a Generator and a Discriminator in an adversarial setup, producing realistic handwritten digits/letters after sufficient training.

## 🚀 Features
- GAN implemented in **PyTorch**
- Configurable latent dimension, learning rate, and training parameters
- Generates new handwriting images from random noise
- Visualization of generated samples during training
- Jupyter Notebook workflow for easy experimentation
